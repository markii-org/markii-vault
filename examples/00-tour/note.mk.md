# Welcome to Markii

This page is a Markii document, and you are standing inside the editor. Change
anything in the left pane and the right pane re-renders as you type. Nothing
you do here can break the page, so poke at everything.

## Start with what you know

Everything markdown does still works: **bold**, links, lists, tables. Markii
adds one rule on top: a *directive* places a component in the document.

:::callout{type=info title="This box is a directive"}
Type `:::callout` on a line, write any markdown inside, close with `:::`.
Try changing `type=info` to `warning`, then to `danger`.
:::

:::callout{type=warning title="Same box, different temper"}
One attribute is the whole difference. Nothing else about the box changes.
:::

:::callout{type=danger title="And the loudest one"}
Colors come from the host's theme, so this stays readable in light and dark.
:::

Small ones fit inside a sentence: press :kbd[Ctrl+Z] if you regret an edit,
and mark things :badge[beta]{variant=info}, :badge[stable]{variant=success},
:badge[slow]{variant=warning}, :badge[broken]{variant=danger}, or leave a
badge :badge[plain] with no variant at all.

## The live part

This document fetches its own data. Rendering never runs code, so the
block below sits inert until you click **Run scripts** above the preview:

```lua {name=repo}
local repo = net.fetch_json("https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react")
return {
  stars = repo.stargazers_count,
  forks = repo.forks_count,
  spark = {3, 5, 4, 8, 7, 10, 12},
}
```

Click Run, then look: facebook/react has :value[repo.stars] stars.

Before the click, that sentence shows a quiet `{repo.stars}` marker, and
every component below shows an empty state. That is the format's core
promise: a document is always readable, with or without its data.

## A dashboard from one value

The script returned one value with three fields, and dotted paths reach into
it. Rows lay components side by side; a `cell` groups blocks into one cell:

::::row{cols=2}
:::cell
::stat{data=repo.stars label="stars" trend=up}
::progress{data=repo.stars max=250000 label="stars toward 250k"}
:::

:::cell
::stat{data=repo.forks label="forks"}
::chart{data=repo.spark kind=line}
:::
::::

Notice the colons: the outer `::::row` uses four, the `:::cell` fences
inside use three. Bigger fence, bigger box.

## Layout without CSS

Plain markdown can be placed too. Wrap anything in `:::center`,
`:::right`, `:::fit`, `:::narrow`, `:::wide`, or `:::full`:

:::center
| build  | status  |
| ------ | ------- |
| `main` | passing |
:::

That table is centered because of the wrapper, not because of anything in
the table. There is deliberately nothing else to learn here: no style
attributes, no pixel values.

A wrapper sets one of the two layout axes, size or place, and takes the
other as an attribute, so one fence can do both. A table is already sized
to its content, so `:::center` alone places it; a callout fills the column,
so it needs `width=fit` before there is anything to center:

::::center{width=fit}
:::callout{type=info}
Sized to its text, then centered.
:::
::::

Aligning the text inside a component is a different job, and it has its own
attribute named after what moves. `row`, `cell`, `card`, and `callout` take
`text`, and a row hands it to every cell:

:::row{cols=3 text=center}
Centered.

Also centered.

And this one too.
:::

A `card` is the other half of the same idea. It draws a raised surface
around whatever you put in it, and it holds ordinary markdown:

::::row{cols=2}
:::card
### A card
Headings, lists, and `code` all work inside one.
:::

:::card
### Another
Cards in a row share the width evenly, and stack when the pane gets narrow.
:::
::::

## More to play with

Tabs hold alternative views of the same spot:

::::tabs
:::tab{label="Why Markii?"}
Notes deserve components without becoming code. A Markii file stays plain
readable markdown in every editor on earth.
:::
:::tab{label="Non-goals"}
No expressions, no conditionals, no loops. A note is not a program, and the
syntax is designed so it never can be.
:::
::::

Details fold long content away. Add the bare `open` attribute to start
one expanded:

:::details{title="Click to expand"}
A collapsible block, closed by default. How is the tour so far, by the way?
::rating{value=5 max=5}
:::

And a figure pairs an image with a markdown caption:

::::figure{src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markii-org/markii/refs/heads/main/apps/playground/public/nature.jpeg"}

**Figure 1.** The caption is markdown, so it can hold *emphasis* or links.
::::

A divider marks a section break without borrowing CommonMark's `---`:

::divider{label="Part 2" variant="dots"}


## Now break something

Rename `callout` above to `callotu` and watch: the page does not crash. An
unknown name renders a labeled box with its content intact, which is what
lets a note travel to machines with different components installed:

:::timeline{src="repo.json"}
Nothing here registers `timeline`, so this shows the fallback with the
content preserved. Nothing is lost.
:::

Two smaller mistakes get their own quiet markers rather than silence. An
inline component given attributes but no text has nothing to show, so it
says so on hover:

::badge{label="wrong"}

And a block component written as though it were inline is labeled where it
sits, without disturbing the sentence around it: :stat[oops]{data=nothing}
lands mid-paragraph and the paragraph survives.

Directive syntax inside a code fence stays literal, so examples are safe:

```
:::callout{type=info}
Not rendered, because it is inside a fence.
:::
```

## Where to go next

This playground is a demo, not the product. The format and its libraries
live in the [repository](https://github.com/markii-org/markii). The
